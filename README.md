# Allergen Recipes

**_Javascript, NextJs, Context, CSS, TailwindCSS, HTML_**

- I wanted to create an app for friends and family to find recipes that catered to their dietary restrictions. I also wanted to save those recipes locally for easy access.
- Built with Next.js and TailwindCSS, featuring API integration for recipe searches and dietary filtering in a custom JavaScript function. Added local storage and context used for saving recipes and managing state with the project.
